# philosopher-wars

TLDR Summary:
just a chat app where philosophers can argument with each other

Idea:
Hey, Githubers! Do you love philosophy and debating? Do you want to have fun and learn something new at the same time? If yes, then I have an awesome project for you! 🙌

I want to create a chat app that is like a game of philosopher wars, where you can play as your favorite philosopher and argument with other players about different topics. You can choose from Plato, Descartes, Kant, Nietzsche, and many more, or create your own philosopher with a cool name and avatar. You can also be a moderator and set the rules of the debate, keep the peace, and decide who wins. 🏆

The chat app will have different chat rooms based on different themes, such as ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, etc. Each chat room will have a specific question or issue that the philosophers have to debate about, such as “Does God exist?”, “Is morality objective or subjective?”, “What is the meaning of life?”, etc. The philosophers will take turns to present their arguments and counterarguments, using logic, evidence, examples, quotes, etc., to support their claims and refute their opponents. The moderator will monitor the debate and intervene if necessary, such as by asking clarifying questions, pointing out logical fallacies, providing feedback, etc. The moderator will also decide when the debate is over and announce the winner based on the quality and persuasiveness of the arguments. 💯

The chat app will be fun and educational, as you can learn from different perspectives and challenge your own beliefs. It will also improve your critical thinking and logical reasoning skills. It will also foster a culture of dialogue and respect among people with different opinions and backgrounds. It will also encourage curiosity and creativity among the players. 🧠

But I can’t do this alone. I need your help to make this chat app a reality. I need people who have skills and experience in:

Web development: To create the front-end and back-end of the chat app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, etc. 💻
Graphic design: To create the user interface and graphics of the chat app using Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. 🎨
Philosophy: To provide the content and knowledge of the chat app regarding different philosophical topics and arguments. 📚
